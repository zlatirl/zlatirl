## Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="24">

I'm `zlatirl` pretty much everywhere on the internet.

I'm a **Computer Science Graduate**, with an interest in **SQL**, **Java**, and **JavaScript** â€” particularly in building backend systems, and game servers.

I'm open to **software engineering opportunities** and excited to work on challenging projects that push me to grow.

## ðŸ§  What I do in my spare time

I spend a lot of my free time working on **Final Fantasy XI private server development**, where I tinker with **custom Lua scripts**, dive into **C++ core features**, and explore **SQL database structure**
(hey, I'm still learning - but we all gotta start somewhere, right? ðŸ˜…).

This hands-on work â€” plus personal projects and university coursework has helped me build experience across a range of programming languages and tools:
